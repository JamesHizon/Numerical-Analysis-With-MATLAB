# Numerical-Analysis-With-MATLAB
Projects from my Numerical Analysis course requiring the usage of MATLAB.

numdiff.m:
Calculate derivatives, absolute and relative error, while storing data into a matrix.
Created a function that calls functions and outputs result matrix.

romberg.m:
Created a function, and called function to output a resulting matrix.
Incorporate romberg integration, where we use both the Composite Trapezoid rule and Richardson extrapolation method.
Lastly, we use iteration to store data into a matrix.
